## Regex Components

In our code we are using multiple parenthesis``` ()``` , brackets``` []``` , a caret``` ^``` , double backslashes``` \\``` , the letter s, the plus operator``` +``` , a period``` .``` , multiple question marks``` ?``` , the letter i, our file extension names``` jpe?g,png,gif,bmp``` , the pipe character``` |``` , and a dollar sign``` $```. By arranging these characters like they are below, we are telling the computer to perform our explicit task.

```([^\\s]+(\\.(?i)(jpe?g|png|gif|bmp))$)```
